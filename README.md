## System Architecture
TalentScout is built upon a modular architecture to ensure maintainability and scalability. Each major component is encapsulated in a dedicated module or folder. This encapsulation allows easy updates, clear coding structure, and reusability across different functionalities.

### Modular Design
1. **Validation and Resume Processing**  
    - Handles user input validation and resume parsing.  
    - Uses regex extensively to check candidate information (e.g., phone number, email).  
2. **User Interface**  
    - Developed with Streamlit for an intuitive experience.  
    - Structured layout ensures clarity for both candidates and administrators.  
3. **Assessment and Scoring**  
    - Dynamically generates questions based on experience, tech stack, and prior answers.  
    - Maintains a confidence score that adjusts after every response.  
4. **Reporting**  
    - Facilitates feedback generation and downloadable reports.  
    - Highlights strengths, weaknesses, and possible areas for improvement.  
5. **LLM Integration**  
    - Tightly integrated with the Llama 3.3 70B Versatile model for fast, contextually relevant responses.  
    - Utilizes advanced prompt engineering for improved question accuracy.

  If a user declares Python and Django, relevant Python/Django questions are generated.  
- **Adaptability**  
  Incorporates the confidence score and previous correct/incorrect answers to refine future questions.  
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**  
  Uses specialized queries to the Llama 3.3 70B Versatile model for relevant, targeted questions.

---

### Confidence Scoring
- **Real-time Adjustments**  
  Increases if users perform well on complex prompts and decreases for incorrect or skipped simple questions.
- **Holistic Assessment**  
  Balances technical correctness, clarity, and completeness of answers.  
- **Influence on Flow**  
  Helps the system decide whether to pose more challenging questions or revert to fundamentals.

---

### Feedback and Reporting

  Outlines the user’s performance, highlighting strong and weak points.  
- **Downloadable Formats**  
  Enables JSON or text export for later review.  
- **Progress Visibility**  
  Displays confidence scores and significant metrics in real time.  
- **Actionable Insights**  
  Suggests areas of further learning or preparation based on question performance.

---

### Advanced Prompt Engineering
